# How to Ask a Girl Out

## History
During your time in CS 360 with Dr. Huang at The University of Tennessee, he asks someone to come up to the whiteboard and write a program on how to ask a girl out. My original whiteboard implementation was in Python, the code was simple, exit(); well challenge accepted.

## Usage
This program requires Python 3 or higher. We also use Gmail SMTP to send notification and confirmation emails.

(Note if you are using **Hydra at UTK**, make sure to run **python setshell.py** first, then run **python -V** to make sure you are on python 3.X.X)

1. Update notifycontact.txt, with your email to receive notifications are the program is ran
2. Update auth.txt with your gmail email address you want the emails to come from, and the password for the account (gmail SMTP for sending emails is used)
3. Then distribute to the person you want to ask out
4. They will run the program with **python setup.py theirEmail@domain.com**
